"""Keep the operator's proxy credential inside the proxy.

``HEADROOM_PROXY_TOKEN`` authenticates a client *to Headroom*. It must never
reach a model provider. Clients send it in one of several places — the explicit
``x-headroom-proxy-token`` header, or ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``, which is
what most SDKs do when they are pointed at a proxy — and before this module the
``Authorization`` form was forwarded upstream verbatim, handing the operator's
credential to the provider (and to any ``x-headroom-base-url`` upstream) as if it
were an API key.

The fix is deliberately *value-based*, not *path-based*:

* A header is removed when its credential value **is** the proxy token (exactly,
  or as the credential part of ``<scheme> <token>``), whatever the header is
  called. That covers ``authorization``, ``x-api-key``, ``api-key``,
  ``x-goog-api-key`` and anything a future provider adapter invents.
* It does not depend on *how* the security gate decided to let the request in.
  Loopback callers and trusted-gateway CIDRs skip the token check, but a loopback
  client that sends the token anyway must not leak it either.

:class:`ProxyCredentialScrubMiddleware` applies the rule **innermost** — after
the security gate and after proxy extensions, immediately before routing. Every
handler, backend adapter (LiteLLM, any-llm), WebSocket relay, gateway turn and
background poller therefore receives a request that no longer carries the token.
